Ideas:
------
x Upload to repository the instrumented version of the mpiJob built by delve compiler.
    No, that's not gonna work, I'm pretty sure we need the dlv debugger to be installed on the machine that we're running the debug build on, because it runs the build on a delve debugger server. So without the server it's not going to work. 

DONE First change from invoking panic function to reading the error message being returned.

Also check if the watch object being returned is nil or not.

DONE Another simple hack we can try is change the call order of pods.Watch and mpiJobs.Watch.
