Elaborate on what these argument types are.
Check what the associated data types in oms or the ui are.

<model>
    Model digest or model name. 
    In oms source code it's represented as string type.
    Model digests appear to be strings of 32 alphanumeric characters.

<lang>   
    Language code. 
    Existing language codes: EN, FR. 
    If no language code is specified in requests that have a language code argument then the browser language setting is used.

<run>     
    Model run digest, run stamp or run name, modeling task run stamp or task run name.

<set>    
    Name of workset (input set of model parameters).
    Workset is another name for model scenario.
    Each model has a default scenario (created during model build process I think).

<profile>
    Profile name.
    Something like a configuration file for how to run a specific model.
    The settings specified in profiles are distinct from model parameter values specified in scenarios.

<task>
    Modeling task.
