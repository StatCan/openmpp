Overview of service architecture in terms of Kubernetes objects:

Basic service offering:
    LoadBalancer
    Service
    Deployment

Limitations of basic service:
    Doesn't distinguish between different users, so essentially not a multi-user setup.
    There is no authentication process for access to service.
    Activities of one user will overlap with activities of another user.
    No persistent storage implemented, so no results will persist when service is restarted.

Stateful set based offering:
    Ingress
    Service (headless)
    StatefulSet
    PersistentVolume

MPI parallel computation backend:
    Service
    Pod (manual specification)
    StatefulSet
    Secret
    ConfigMap
    NetworkPolicy
    PodDisruptionBudget
