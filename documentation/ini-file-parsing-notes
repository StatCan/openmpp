Some initial notes about the ini file parsing:
    loadini function parses ini file content into a map[string]string and returns the map
    ini file content is provided as a string argument
    Concatenation of section and key into section.key is used as the map key 
    comments are ignored
    
    strings.IndexAny(s, chars string) int
        Checks if any of the characters in chars are contained in s.
        If there are, it returns the index of the first such character in s.
        Otherwise it returns -1.

    nextPos := The index of the next line termination character in iniContent
    nStart := Index of the character in the input string that marks where the current line ends.
    line := 
        A slice containing the next line of configuration input.
        Currently it splits on encountering line termination characters.
        We'll have to make changes at this level because the line to be parsed needs to retain value information from multiple lines.

    strings.TrimSpace(

    The parser looks for line termination characters first.
    It then selects a substring of the input string that corresponds to one line in the config file.
