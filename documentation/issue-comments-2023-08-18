Clarifying project direction and deliverables:
  We decided to work towards implementing a cloud offering that has feature parity with the existing microsimulation web service operated by the OpenM++ team on GCP.

Progress made:
  Did some more background reading of Kubernetes documentation.
  Identified Kubernetes objects that will be needed in subsequent iterations of the service.
  Located a github project that appears to be an implementation of OpenMPI on Kubernetes.

Tasks going forward:
  For deploying the basic service:
    Assign a domain name.
    Upload container image to the standard location for AAW. (optional)
    Replace the LoadBalancer object with appropriate routing rules in the existing AAW Ingress object. (optional)
    Incorporate into the CI/CD setup used by AAW. (optional)

  For service implemented using a StatefulSet workload:
    Package deployment into a Helm chart.
    Research how to specify PersistentVolumes and how to map to appropriate instances of the web service.
    Research how to authenticate different users and how to route their session to appropriate instances of the web service.

  For the OpenMPI backend service:
    Work through the github project and try to get any MPI job running on a Kubernetes cluster.
    Study the implementation to determine how to deploy it as a backend service that can be used by the OpenM++ web service instances.
